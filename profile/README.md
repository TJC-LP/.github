THE PERFORMANCE FOLLOWS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TJC seeks to partner with profitable companies and exceptional management teams to realize significant potential opportunities for long-term growth. For over 40 years, we have continually demonstrated our commitment to investors and management teams, and to the successful strategies and plans we partner to put in place together.

OVER 40-YEAR HISTORY FOCUSED ON HELPING BUSINESSES GROW
-------------------------------------------------------

TJC has evolved and refined our investment strategy and approach over the past 40+ years. As a result, we have deep sector knowledge with specialties across five industry verticals.

*   39% Diversified Industrials
*   26% Consumer & Healthcare
*   17% Logistics & Supply Chain
*   10% Technology & Infrastructure
*   8% Industrial Technology

In 1982, TJC was founded as a middle market private investment partnership focused on leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations. Today, we’re managed by a senior leadership team that has invested together for over 23 years and partnered with management teams on over 85 investments. We believe this cumulative experience not only enhances informed decision making, but it also allows us to be consistent partners across and through market cycles to achieve long-term success.

### VALUE-ADDED INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We seek to buy and help build established middle market companies with enterprise values ranging from $100 million to $2 billion across a range of industries. We target partners that are well-managed, with consistent revenue growth and profitability, and an identifiable opportunity for long-term future growth.

### MANAGEMENT ALIGNMENT

We are convinced that strong management is vital, and we look for businesses that have senior teams with a proven track record. In our transactions, management works alongside us toward the longer-term upside of a significant equity stake.

### HANDS-ON OPERATIONAL SUPPORT

We believe our investment performance can be attributed, in part, to our commitment to hands-on operating support, including our Operations Management Group, which focuses on strategies to enhance internal growth and identify and execute on acquisition opportunities.

### FLEXIBLE DEAL STRUCTURES

Our transactions provide liquidity for owners, raise capital for growth and create significant equity opportunities for key management through leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, public-to-privates, strategic build-ups/consolidations and growth capital.

The Partner for You
-------------------

Building long-term relationships

> “Reputation is key to our success. It’s been the reason we’re still here today and will be here in 20 years. It’s taken us 40 years to build that reputation and you can lose it in a minute. So, we pay a lot of attention to it. We try to be very clear in our communications with owners, with investment bankers, with lawyers, everyone, to give a clear message . . . We like to be very definitive and, as a result, people like to deal with us because they’re not getting head faked.”
